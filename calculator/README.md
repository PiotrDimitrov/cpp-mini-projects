# String Calculator

This project is a C++ program that acts as a string calculator. It takes a mathematical expression as a string input and returns the result, adhering to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS rules). Works only with integers.

## Overview

The String Calculator processes mathematical expressions provided as strings and computes the result. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, while respecting the precedence of operators (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`
- Handles parentheses for grouping expressions
- Follows the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)
- Provides detailed error messages for invalid inputs

## Example

Input: 3 - 8 * 3 + 7 ^ 2 - 1 + 1

Output: 28

Input: ( -2 - 3) * (7 + 4) / 5

Output: -11
