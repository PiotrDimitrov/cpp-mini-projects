# C++ Mini-Projects

Welcome to the repository for my C++ mini-projects. This repository contains a collection of small projects and exercises that I have created to practice and demonstrate various C++ programming concepts.

## Projects

Here are the mini-projects included in this repository:

1. **Project 1: Integer String Calculator**
   - A simple calculator that takes matematical expression and returns the result in accordance to PEMDAS.
2. **Project 2: Big numbers container**
   - A project consisting a class container to store and process huge numbers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the projects on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., g++, clang++)
- **Make** (optional, for building projects with a Makefile)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory you want to work on:

    ```sh
    cd project-directory
    ```

### Usage

To compile and run a project, follow these steps:

1. **Using a Makefile (if available):**

    ```sh
    make
    ./project-executable
    ```

2. **Without a Makefile:**

    ```sh
    g++ -o project-executable main.cpp
    ./project-executable
    ```

*Note: Replace `main.cpp` and `project-executable` with your project's source file and desired executable name.*
